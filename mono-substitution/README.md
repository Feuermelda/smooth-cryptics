# Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher

A simple Python script that encrypts messages using a randomly generated monoalphabetic substitution key

## How It Works
- Generates a shuffled version of the alphabet
- Maps each letter in the input message to a unique substitute letter
- Keeps spaces and punctuation intact

## Example
Plaintext: `HELLO WORLD`  
Ciphertext: `SQTTE FEUTZ`  
Key: (randomly generated)

## How to Use
1. Run the script
2. Enter the message you'd like to encrypt
3. Get your encrypted message and key

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
(No external libraries needed)

## Notes
This is a classical encryption method and **not secure for real-world communication.**  
It's purely for educational and cryptographic practice
