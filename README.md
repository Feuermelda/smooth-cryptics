# Smooth Cryptics

A personal cryptography learning journey featuring classic ciphers, modern encryption techniques, and steganographic mischief.

## Projects

### Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher
- Random substitution key generator
- Encrypts uppercase messages
- [View Project](mono_substitution/)

### Onion Layer Encryption
- Simulates Tor-style layered encryption using:
    - Caesar Cipher
    - Vigenère Cipher
    - Monoalphabetic Substitution
- Includes bonus relay log with surreal node names
- [View Project](onion_layer_encryption/)

### AES CBC Encryption
- Encrypts and decrypts messages using AES in CBC mode
- Includes IV generation and byte padding
- Great intro to block ciphers and symmetric encryption
- [View Project](aes_cbc_encryption/)

### HMAC From Scratch
- Implements HMAC manually using SHA256
- Demonstrates inner/outer pad logic and message integrity
- [View Project](hmac-from-scratch/)

### Password Hasher Salt
- Hashes passwords using SHA256 with added salt
- Simulates login verification
- Includes rainbow table prevention demo
- [View Project](password-hasher-salt/)

### RSA PGP Messenger
- Encrypts messages with RSA + AES (hybrid approach)
- Adds digital signatures for authenticity and integrity
- Inspired by PGP-style secure messaging
- [View Project](rsa-pgp-messenger/)

### Diffie-Hellman Simulation
- Simulates secure shared-key exchange using Diffie-Hellman
- Demonstrates modular exponentiation and public/private key math
- Prints warning if shared secrets don't match
- [View Project](diffie-hellman-sim/)

### More coming soon...
- Steganography?
- Stream ciphers?
- One-Time Pads?
- Who knows what cryptic curiosities await...
