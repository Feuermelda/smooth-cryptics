- Encrypts uppercase messages
- [View Project](mono_substitution/)

### Onion Layer Encryption
- Simulates Tor-style layered encryption using:
    - Caesar Cipher
    - Vigen√®re Cipher
    - Monoalphabetic Substitution
- Includes bonus relay log with surreal node names
- [View Project](onion_layer_encryption/)
