# Onion Layer Encryption

This Python project simulates multi-layer encryption, inspired by Tor's onion routing system.

## Features
- Three encryption layers: Caesar, Vigenère, Mono Substitution
- Randomized cipher order
- Random relay name logging

## Usage
- Input your plaintext message
- Watch it pass through surreal relay nodes
- Receive final ciphertext
- Designed for educational and entertainment purposes

## Files
- `onion.py` - main orchestrator
- `caesar.py` - Caesar cipher
- `vigenere.py` - Vigenère cipher
- `mono_substitution.py` - substitution logic
- `milk_eel_bonus.py` - bonus relay logging version
